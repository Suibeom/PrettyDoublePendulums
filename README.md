# PrettyDoublePendulums
Port of a small part of the source code for Sam Maksimovich's stunning video on the double pendulum fractal ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7JK4Ht8k8M ) to a Pluto.jl notebook. Unfortunately slightly unstable with large number of images at the moment! Still work-in-progress.
